abstract: The NACHT-, leucine-rich-repeat-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is a critical intracellular inflammasome sensor and an important clinical target against inflammation-driven human diseases. Recent studies have elucidated its transition from a closed cage to an activated disk-like inflammasome, but the intermediate activation mechanism remains elusive. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of NLRP3, which forms an open octamer and undergoes a ~ 90° hinge rotation at the NACHT domain. Mutations on open octamer’s interfaces reduce IL-1β signaling, highlighting its essential role in NLRP3 activation/inflammasome assembly. The centrosomal NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) disrupts large NLRP3 oligomers and forms NEK7/NLRP3 monomers/dimers which is a critical step preceding the assembly of the disk-like inflammasome. These data demonstrate an oligomeric cooperative activation of NLRP3 and provide insight into its inflammasome assembly mechanism.
